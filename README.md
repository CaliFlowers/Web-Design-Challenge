## Data Analytics and Web Design
Web design can rightly be viewed as tangential to a data analyst. HTML is, at best, a fairly simple programming language. It has no data functions; It doesn't facilitate aggregation; and it doesn't facilitate data analysis in any intuitive manner. It's still, however, essential for a data analyst to understand the basics of web design because not all data is retrievable as conveniently formatted tables or databases. An understading of the basic components of a web page can facilitate the extraction of data; much in the same way  Python APIsrequire an understanding of JSON formats. 
Another reason to learn HTML is, as demonstrated in this project, that a data analyst might wat to be able to directly communicate their findings to the public; and web pages are a convenient manner to do this. 

## HTML
Web Design requires a trifecta of programming languages hat each serve a niche function: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)  is important primarily because it forms the structural skeleton of the web pages that populate the Internet. HTML defines the outline of every visible component of a web page including but not limited to text,toolbars, images, buttons, etc. This mini-project utilizes primarily HTML to make several pages for a project website. HTML tags defie the navbar, imagem text, and sectioning of the pages made for this example. 

#CSS
Cascading Style Sheets or CSS complements HTML. Whereas HTML defines the structure of a webpage; CSS is about presentation. CSS styles webpages by adding color, formatting, sizing, and other visual elements to an HTML skeleton
