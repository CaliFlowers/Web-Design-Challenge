## Data Analytics and Web Design
Web design can rightly be viewed as tangential to a data analyst. HTML is, at best, a fairly simple programming language. It has no data functions; It doesn't facilitate aggregation; and it doesn't facilitate data analysis in any intuitive manner. It's still, however, essential for a data analyst to understand the basics of web design because not all data is retrievable as conveniently formatted tables or databases. An understading of the basic components of a web page can facilitate the extraction of data; much in the same way  Python APIsrequire an understanding of JSON formats. 
Another reason to learn HTML is, as demonstrated in this project, that a data analyst might wat to be able to directly communicate their findings to the public; and web pages are a convenient manner to do this. 

## HTML
Web Design requires a trifecta of programming languagesthat each serve a niche function: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)  is important primarily because it forms the structural skeleton of the web pages that populate the Internet.
