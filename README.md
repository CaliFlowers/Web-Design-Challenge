## Data Analytics and Web Design
Web design can rightly be viewed as tangential to a data analyst. HTML is, at best, a fairly simple programming language. It has no data functions; It doesn't facilitate aggregation; and it doesn't facilitate data analysis in any intuitive manner. It's still, however, essential for a data analyst to understand the basics of web design because not all data is retrievable as conveniently formatted tables or databases. An understading of the basic components of a web page can facilitate the extraction of data; much in the same way  Python APIs require an understanding of JSON formats. 
Another reason to learn HTML is, as demonstrated in this project, that a data analyst might wat to be able to directly communicate their findings to the public; and web pages are a convenient manner to do this. 

## Weatherworld
Weatherworld is a previous mini=project re-presented as a project website on GitHub pages. Weatherworld uses global weather data obtained on November 22, 2020
 at 7:52 AM, GMT to visualize and explain four different weather phenomena and their relationship with certain geographic qualities

## HTML
Web Design requires a trifecta of programming tools that each serve a niche function: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)  is important primarily because it forms the structural skeleton of the web pages that populate the Internet. HTML defines the outline of every visible component of a web page including but not limited to text,toolbars, images, buttons, etc. This mini-project utilizes primarily HTML to make several pages for a project website. HTML tags defie the navbar, imagem text, and sectioning of the pages made for this example. 

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets or CSS complements HTML. Whereas HTML defines the structure of a webpage; CSS is about presentation. CSS styles webpages by adding color, formatting, sizing, and other visual elements to an HTML skeleton. An HTML skeleton without CSS would be akin to a human body without skin. The webpages would be functional, but it wouldn't look so visually appealing. This mini-project uses minimal CSS to demonstrate the aesthetic function played by CSS in Web Design, and sme ore for the CSS fornatting assciated with the Bootstrap components. CS can be applied through a CSS style sheet; but this example opts for the application of CSS styling inside the HTML tags. Both methods result in functional styling.

## Javascript
Javascript is the final leg of the trifecta of programming tools used for webpages. It adds interactivity to web pages. For this example, it is used to make the webpages responsive to the resizing of the screen. It has other applications that weren't explored for this mini-project.However, enough use was made of Javascript to justify mentioning its role here. 

## Bootstrap
The Web Design trifecta are three discrete tools. However, a tool called Bootstrap integrates all three tools to simplify the process of web design. Bootstrap components provide most of the HTML needed to create a functional skeleton; while providing just eough CSS for a minimalist aesthetic. Lastly, Bootstrap provides the Javascipt necessary to make webpages responsive to changes in screen sizes. For a data analyst who would prefer to specialize in tasks germane to dta analytics, Bootstrap is a useful tool  for designing project web sites for the purpose of simply communicating their work. 

In this example, the most extensive uses of Bootstrap are evident in the Navbar, a Bootstrap component, and the use of the Bootstrap grid to structure the contents of the webpages deployed.
